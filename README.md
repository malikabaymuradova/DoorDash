Python files include:
1) Figuiring out the columns with Null values 
2) Imputations for missing values in the arrived_to_restaurant_datetime
3) Correlation Analysis: Delivery Time and Tip Amount
4) Dataset with filled values derived from the imputations
5) Added madeup year and month for each datetime column so that it will be easier to perform datetime functions in SQL

SQL Queries were used to find:
1) Top 5 Restaurants for each region 
2) Restaurants with lowest number of orders and total amount generated for DoorDash
3) For each region, total number of orders and total order amount
4) For each hour, total number of orders
5) Total orders for each hour for each week over one monthspan (not included in the deliverable)
6) Find returning consumers and identify their favorite restaurants 


Visualisations: 
After I have perfomred necessary SQL queries, I have downloaded the results and uploaded them to Google Sheet
- All the visualisations were created using Google Sheets
