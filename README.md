# Exploratory Data Analysis on DoorDash's dataset  

## Overview

* Cleaned, aggregated, and analyzed a large unstructured 18,000+ dataset of deliveries for one month using Python and SQL to derive actionable insights 
* Saved 40% of missing data in one of the timestamp columns through imputations 
* Used cleaned quantitative data to develop an understanding of business KPIs (e.g. average order volume, number of returning customers)
* Visualized findings using Google Sheets and Python 

## Goal
Analyze DoorDash's dataset and generate some specific recommendations or improvements on their business.

## Code and Resources Used:
* **Python Version:** 3.9 
* **Packages**: pandas, numpy, jupyter notebooks
* **Relational database management system:** Postgresql 
* **GUI tool:** pgAdmin 4

## Step 1: Familiarize yourself with DoorDashâ€™s business model 
## Step 2: Familiarize yourself with the dataset
Understand what kind of information it includes, what is the data type for each column, make a note of columns with NULL values & decide what you want to do with them (delete or use imputations to fill in the missing values)
## Step 3: Ask Questions
Use bottom-up approach: Start by looking at the dataset and trying to come up with things to investigate. First, try asking broad questions and see what can you learn from this dataset, and what potential valuable insights can you generate?
Keep in mind what will be of value for the DoorDash and its three sides of business. Why did they decide to collect this information? What do they care about and how this information can be helpful for them?
